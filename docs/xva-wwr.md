## TL;DR — Executive Walkthrough

>If wrong-way risk is modelled using correlation-based approaches, it may fail to capture i
>directionality or concentration under stress, and does not distinguish between 
>correlation and causation.

>This system instead evaluates CVA under structural macroeconomic shocks using a 
>causal model (SCM). Wrong-way risk is analysed via explicit interventions (do-operations) 
>on macro factors (e.g. oil, rates, FX), so the reported CVA reflects how the portfolio 
>responds when those drivers are actively moved, rather than merely observed to co-move.


The system computes CVA for a portfolio under these structural shocks, calculates full 
risk sensitivities in a single reverse-mode AAD pass, ranks counterparties by their 
causal exposure using elasticity measures, and produces hedge recommendations via 
convex optimisation.

Structural relationships (e.g. macro → hazard/exposure) can be calibrated from data, so 
the wrong-way risk analysis is grounded in an estimated causal model rather than 
assumed correlations. Symbolic differentiation of pricing functions is supported, and
all components run within a single framework.



**What goes in**

- A deterministic 200-trade book over 30 counterparties with CSA terms
- An OIS / hazard / recovery / FX market state, plus per-CP shock βs
- A 6-node SCM linking `oil → {usd-rates, fx, energy-credit} → exposure, hazard`
- A symbolic swap-leg expression `f(r) = N · (1 − e^{−rτ}) / r`
- A 3×3 covariance prefix from a SIMM-style 10×10 IR-delta block

**What happens (nine sections + diagnostics, one binary, ~35 s)**

1. Build a deterministic book and market state (§1, §2)
2. **Calibrate the SCM βs by ML on a synthetic shock × hazard panel (§3a)**
3. Draw seeded torch shocks → per-CP exposure curve (§3)
4. Aggregate CVA per counterparty and per book (§4)
5. Take all risk-factor sensitivities in **one AAD backward pass** (§5)
6. Re-price under `do(oil = −30%)` via tilt + hazard transform (§6)
7. Sweep ± shocks; rank by **causal elasticity** ε = ∂log CVA / ∂(do-var) (§7)
8. Build a swap-leg pricer symbolically; lower onto the **same** tape (§8)
9. Compress hot-CP exposure via convex QP on a SIMM Σ block; emit an
   actionable unwind set (§9)

After §7, a **WWR Diagnostics** block decomposes the dominant CP's
elasticity into per-factor β contributions, stress-tests the ranking
under β-perturbation, and contrasts the result against a
correlation-only WWR baseline. A determinism / shard-replay check
runs in CI; it lives in the
[Technical Appendix](#technical-appendix--deterministic-shard-replay)
because it is plumbing, not a desk-facing result.

**What comes out**

A single association list with the baseline CVA, the AAD gradient
vector, per-shock book CVA, ranked elasticity buckets, the symbolic
node count and lowered-kernel value, the QP objective value, the
ML-recovered β alist, the training trace, and the shard-replay match
flag — every value traceable back to the stage that produced it.

```

`run-demo` is intentionally side-effect-free; the **friendly
stage-by-stage report** below is produced by `(main)`, which calls
`run-demo` then hands the artifact to `report:print-friendly-report`
(see [`examples/xva-wwr/report.eta`](../examples/xva-wwr/report.eta)).

## Why This Matters

Standard XVA stacks split the problem into a Monte Carlo engine, a
risk decomposition layer, a scenario tool, and a hedge-suggestion
spreadsheet. Each of those four layers has its own model of "what the
world looks like under stress", and they almost never agree. Eta
unifies them in one semantic substrate.

| Problem in standard XVA pipelines | What goes wrong | How Eta addresses it |
|---|---|---|
| WWR proxied by correlation multipliers | Misses the **direction** of the shock; understates joint left-tail | SCM with explicit `do(...)` intervention (§6, §7) |
| Greeks computed by bump-and-revalue | Slow, noisy, miss cross-effects | One reverse-mode AAD backward pass (§5) |
| **SCM β's hand-set / silently mis-calibrated** | Stress numbers depend on parameters the model never sees again | ML calibration on a synthetic shock × hazard panel; max-error tolerance asserted in CI (§3a) |
| Stress and pricing are separate code paths | Stress numbers stop matching the desk's CVA | Stress = `do(...)` re-run of the **same** `cva-table` (§6) |
| Hedge suggestions live in Excel | Risk-equivalent unwind set produced by hand | Convex QP over CLP(R) on a SIMM Σ block (§9) |
| AAD and CAS in different languages | Symbolic derivative needs a Python source-to-source step | Symbolic kernel lowered onto the **same** AAD tape (§8) |
| Reproducibility relies on operator discipline | Identical inputs → different prints | Seeded torch RNG + actor shard replay with hash assert ([appendix](#technical-appendix--deterministic-shard-replay)) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All components — symbolic,  AAD, optimisation, and causal interventions — run in one unified system.

### What Breaks If You Remove a Component

| Remove | What goes wrong |
|---|---|
| SCM (§6) | Stress is reduced to a static correlation multiplier; ranking flips that the structural shock would expose stay hidden |
| **ML calibration (§3a)** | The βs become an *assertion*. With it, the same numbers are *reproduced from data*; without it the demo cannot diff the SCM against its own DGP |
| AAD (§5) | Greeks degrade to bump-and-revalue: O(N) re-pricings, no cross-effects |
| Elasticity sweep (§7) | One shock can be cherry-picked; no ranked heat-map for the desk |
| Symbolic kernel (§8) | The pricer is opaque; you cannot derive ∂V/∂r symbolically and reuse it on the same tape |
| Convex QP (§9) | "CP-17 widened by 87%" has no actionable answer |
| Seeded actor replay ([appendix](#technical-appendix--deterministic-shard-replay)) | Reproducibility becomes an operator-discipline problem; CI cannot assert it |

| Tape generation drifts | AAD greeks become `kStaleRef` errors at the boundary | `do_binary_arithmetic` returns `kTagStaleRef` (see [`vm.cpp`](../eta/core/src/eta/runtime/vm/vm.cpp)) |

```

The pipeline is acyclic at the stage level. Each layer is correct in
its own semantics; composition guarantees compatibility, not
equivalence. The dotted edge from §5 to §8 is the load-bearing claim:
the symbolic kernel is lowered onto the **same** AAD tape that
priced §5. The dotted edge from §3a to §6 is the load-bearing claim
of the ML stage: the βs that drive the hazard transform are recovered
from data, not asserted as literals — the SCM is *self-consistent
against its own DGP*.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  WHAT:   Recover beta_{i,var} sensitivities of d log lambda_i to the
          macro shock vector (oil, usd-10y, eur-usd) from a synthetic

  WHY:    Turns the headline 'CP-17 explodes under oil' from an

          becomes self-consistent against its own DGP.
  MATH:   Delta log lambda_i = beta_i . z_t + eps_i,  eps_i ~ N(0, sigma^2)
          estimator: nn.Linear(3, 30), MSE loss, Adam optimiser.
  CAUSAL: z_t drawn iid from N(0, I) -> exogenous by construction;

  WHAT:   Expected loss = E[ exposure x default x (1 - recovery) ]

  WHY:    Reference number; counterfactuals in stage 4 measure

[4/8]  Counterfactual sweep - do(var = +/- shock)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  WHAT:   Re-price the book under a do-intervention on each macro
          driver, then derive a per-CP elasticity
            eps = (log CVA_up - log CVA_down) / Delta_shock.
  WHY:    Sign of eps is the *causal* WWR test:
            eps > 0  -> wrong-way   (CP defaults *more* when MtM is up)
            eps < 0  -> right-way   (natural hedge)
            eps ~ 0  -> insensitive
  CAUSAL: SCM:  oil -> usd-rates,  oil -> fx-usd,
                oil -> energy-credit -> hazard
          Back-door set empty under the SCM, so do(oil = .) is
          identifiable from observational regression betas.

[5/8]  Symbolic AAD - delta of an annuity kernel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  WHAT:   Differentiate V = N * (1 - exp(-r*tau)) / r   wrt r
          symbolically, then lower the AST to a closure and evaluate.
  WHY:    Bumpless IR-Delta greek; structurally equivalent to AAD but

  WHAT:   Quadratic objective x' Sigma x evaluated on a 3-D prefix of
          the SIMM IR-Delta covariance matrix.

  WHAT:   Run the same Monte-Carlo shard twice and compare.
  WHY:    All seeds are explicit; the demo must be bit-reproducible.

    First run:                          4.96368e+07

  while the leave-one-out greek and ML-recovered SCM betas
  remain consistent with the analytic / hand-coded baselines.

## Headline Properties 

- **Causally-grounded WWR** — stress CVA is `do(m)` re-pricing on the
  same `cva-table`, not a static correlation multiplier. Identification
  is conditional on the assumed SCM.
- **One backward pass** — `cva-with-greeks` returns the value and the
  full risk-factor gradient in one tape sweep (no bump-and-revalue).
- **Same tape, symbolic + numeric** — `lower-expression` walks the
  simplified tree and emits arithmetic into the active AAD tape, so
  symbolic ∂V/∂r records onto the *same* tape that priced CVA.
- **Convex hedge** — compression QP is a strictly convex quadratic on
  a CLP(R)-feasible polytope; `clp:rq-minimize` returns the optimum.
- **Deterministic** — seeded torch RNG plus a deterministic reduction
  order make the shard hash assertable in CI (see
  [Technical Appendix](#technical-appendix--deterministic-shard-replay)).
- **No FVA/MVA/KVA** — this demo is intentionally tight; the headline
  is a faithful, end-to-end CVA + WWR walkthrough, not a full xVA
  stack.

## §1 — Deterministic Book & CSA

The pipeline operates on a synthetic 200-trade book across 30 named
counterparties (`CP-01` … `CP-30`) with CSA terms (threshold, MTA,
MPoR). Trade attributes are deterministic functions of the trade index, 
so the entire run is reproducible from a seed:

| Field | Formula |
|---|---|
| `cp` | `CP-` + `((idx − 1) mod 30) + 1` (zero-padded under 10) |
| `notional` | `1 000 000 + 25 000 · (idx mod 9)` |
| `maturity-years` | `1 + (idx mod 10)` |
| `fixed-rate` | `0.015 + 0.001 · (idx mod 7)` |

```scheme
(defun make-trade (idx)
  (let* ((cp-index   (+ 1 (modulo (- idx 1) 30)))
         (cp         (cp-name cp-index))
         (notional   (+ 1000000 (* 25000 (modulo idx 9))))
         (maturity   (+ 1 (modulo idx 10)))
         (fixed-rate (+ 0.015 (* 0.001 (modulo idx 7)))))
    (list (cons 'id idx)             (cons 'cp cp)
          (cons 'notional notional)  (cons 'maturity-years maturity)
          (cons 'fixed-rate fixed-rate))))

(defun make-book () (map* make-trade (iota 200 1)))
```

CSA terms are similarly deterministic:

```scheme
(defun make-csa (idx)
  (list (cons 'cp        (cp-name idx))
        (cons 'threshold (+ 250000 (* 10000 (modulo idx 5))))
        (cons 'mta       50000)
        (cons 'mpor-days 10)))

(define csa-terms (map* make-csa (iota 30 1)))
```

> [!NOTE]
> **No randomness in the book.** Every trade attribute is a closed
> form in `idx`. This makes git-diff of the artifact a useful CI
> signal: if the book changes shape, every downstream number changes,
> and that change is locatable to one line in `book.eta`.

## §2 — Market State, Hazards, Recoveries, Shock βs

`market.eta` declares the base risk-free rate, baseline EE per
counterparty, baseline hazard $\lambda_i$ and recovery $R_i$, the
factor correlation matrix between the three macro variables, and the
per-CP **shock sensitivities** $\beta_{i,\text{var}}$ used by §6.

$$
r_0 = 0.0325, \qquad
\Sigma_{\text{factor}} = \begin{pmatrix}
1.00 & 0.35 & -0.20 \\
0.35 & 1.00 & 0.30 \\
-0.20 & 0.30 & 1.00
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Baseline closed forms (deterministic in counterparty index $i$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{EE}_{\text{base}}(i) &= 80\,000 + 12\,000 \cdot (i \bmod 11) \\
\lambda_i                  &= 0.012 + 0.0015 \cdot (i \bmod 8)     \\
R_i                        &= 0.45 - 0.02 \cdot (i \bmod 4)
\end{aligned}
$$

```scheme
(defun base-ee       (i) (+ 80000 (* 12000 (modulo i 11))))
(defun base-hazard   (i) (+ 0.012 (* 0.0015 (modulo i 8))))
(defun base-recovery (i) (- 0.45  (* 0.02   (modulo i 4))))

(define baseline-curves   (map* (lambda (i) (cons (cp-name i) (base-ee i)))       (iota 30 1)))
(define hazard-rates      (map* (lambda (i) (cons (cp-name i) (base-hazard i)))   (iota 30 1)))
(define recovery-rates    (map* (lambda (i) (cons (cp-name i) (base-recovery i))) (iota 30 1)))
```

Per-counterparty **shock βs** with three named outliers handcrafted to
make the demo's headline counterparties recognisable (CP-17 is the
energy-heavy name; CP-22 is FX-heavy; CP-12 is the right-way name):

```scheme
(defun cp-betas (i)
  (let ((oil   (+ 0.20 (* 0.06 (modulo i 5))))
        (usd10 (+ 0.10 (* 0.04 (modulo (+ i 2) 4))))
        (fx    (+ 0.08 (* 0.05 (modulo (+ i 1) 6)))))
    (list
      (cons 'oil     (cond ((= i 17)  2.91) ((= i 9)   2.07)
                           ((= i 31) -0.62) (else oil)))
      (cons 'usd-10y (cond ((= i 4)   1.22) ((= i 12) -0.48) (else usd10)))
      (cons 'eur-usd (cond ((= i 22)  1.94) (else fx))))))

(define cp-sensitivity
  (map* (lambda (i) (cons (cp-name i) (cp-betas i))) (iota 30 1)))
```

## §3 — Path Generator (Seeded torch Shocks)

`paths.eta` generates a per-counterparty exposure curve from a single
seeded vector of standard normal shocks. The path scale is a closed
form in `n_paths`, so the *only* RNG entry point is the seed.

$$
\begin{aligned}
z_t &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \quad \text{after } \texttt{(manual-seed seed)} \\
s &= 0.04 + n_{\text{paths}} / 100\,000 \\
\text{EE}_{i,t} &= \max\!\bigl(0,\; \text{EE}_{\text{base}}(i)
                       + \text{EE}_{\text{base}}(i) \cdot s \cdot z_t\bigr)
\end{aligned}
$$

```scheme
(defun draw-shocks (n-steps seed)
  (manual-seed seed)
  (to-list (randn (list n-steps))))

(defun curve-from-shocks (base shocks scale)
  (map* (lambda (z) (max 0.0 (+ base (* base scale z)))) shocks))

(defun simulate-paths (curves g2pp-params fx-corr n-paths n-steps dt seed)
  (let* ((bases      (normalize-bases curves))
         (path-scale (+ 0.04 (/ n-paths 100000.0)))
         (shocks     (draw-shocks n-steps seed)))
    (map*
      (lambda (entry)
        (cons (car entry) (curve-from-shocks (cdr entry) shocks path-scale)))
      bases)))
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Torch primitives** — VM builtins, no Python bridge:
> ```scheme
> (manual-seed 20260427)              ; deterministic torch RNG
> (define z (randn (list 12)))        ; (1×12) tensor of N(0,1)
> (to-list z)                          ; → plain Eta numeric list
> ```
> The path generator deliberately returns Eta numeric lists rather
> than tensors so the AAD tape in §5 can consume them directly.

The **tilted** path used by §6 reuses the same generator with a
re-mixed seed and applies a single multiplicative tilt $k$ per CP:

$$
k = 0.80 \cdot \text{oil} + 0.60 \cdot \text{usd-10y} + 0.50 \cdot \text{eur-usd}
\qquad
\text{EE}'_{i,t} = \max\!\bigl(0,\; \text{EE}_{i,t} \cdot (1 + k)\bigr)
$$

```scheme
(defun total-tilt (tilt)
  (+ (* 0.80 (assoc-num 'oil     tilt 0.0))
     (* 0.60 (assoc-num 'usd-10y tilt 0.0))
     (* 0.50 (assoc-num 'eur-usd tilt 0.0))))

(defun simulate-paths-tilted (curves g2pp-params fx-corr n-paths n-steps dt seed tilt)
  (let* ((base (simulate-paths curves g2pp-params fx-corr n-paths n-steps dt (+ seed 17)))
         (k    (total-tilt tilt)))
    (map* (lambda (entry) (cons (car entry) (apply-tilt (cdr entry) k))) base)))
```

The tilt weights `(0.80, 0.60, 0.50)` are the SCM mechanism
coefficients along the path `do(var) → exposure` — the same mechanism
that `wwr-causal.eta`'s SCM declares.

## §3a — SCM Calibration: Learning the βs (ML)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The hand-coded βs in §2 are the SCM mechanism the demo *asserts*.
> §3a closes the loop by *learning them back* from a synthetic shock ×
> hazard panel drawn from those very literals. The literals remain the
> oracle; the learner is a **recoverability check** that turns the SCM
> from "trust me" into "trust me — and here is the regression result
> that matches the literals to within `max-error ≤ 0.05`".

### Model

The SCM in `wwr-causal.eta` asserts a linear-Gaussian mechanism for
the change in log hazard of CP-$i$ under macro shock $z_t$:

$$
\Delta\log\lambda_{i,t} \;=\;
\beta_{i,\text{oil}}\,\text{oil}_t
\;+\; \beta_{i,\text{usd-10y}}\,\text{usd10y}_t
\;+\; \beta_{i,\text{eur-usd}}\,\text{eurusd}_t
\;+\; \varepsilon_{i,t},
\qquad
\varepsilon_{i,t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2).
$$

This is a linear regression with **3 inputs and 30 outputs** — i.e.
a single `nn.Linear(3, 30)` with no nonlinearity. The fitted weight
matrix $\hat{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{30 \times 3}$ *is* the β estimate;
row $i$ is the sensitivity vector for CP-$i$.

| Object | Math | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Inputs $z_t$ | $(\text{oil}_t,\text{usd-10y}_t,\text{eur-usd}_t)$ | `(randn (list n-obs 3))` |
| True $B$ | $30\times 3$ from `cp-sensitivity` (§2) | `cp-betas-as-tensor` |
| Targets $Y$ | $z B^{\top} + \varepsilon$ | `(t+ (matmul X (transpose B 0 1)) (t* (randn ...) σ))` |
| Estimator $\hat{B}$ | `nn.Linear(3,30).weight` | `(car (parameters model))` |
| Loss | $\lVert Y - z\hat{B}^{\top}\rVert_2^2$ | `mse-loss` |
| Optimiser | Adam, lr = 0.05, 300 epochs | `(adam model 0.05)` |

### Identification — *why this regression is structural*

> [!NOTE]
> A regression of $\Delta\log\lambda$ on macro variables is, in
> general, **associational**. It estimates a *structural* coefficient
> only if there is no back-door path between the regressor and the
> noise. Two regimes:
>
> - **Synthetic data (the demo).** $z_t$ is drawn from `randn` — iid
>   Gaussian, exogenous to $\varepsilon$ by construction. The
>   back-door / front-door criteria from
>   [`stdlib/std/causal.eta`](../stdlib/std/causal.eta) report the
>   empty adjustment set, so the OLS / `nn.Linear` coefficient *is*
>   the structural β.
>
>   ```scheme
>   (do:identify scm 'hazard 'oil)
>   ;; => (adjust () (regress-on (oil)))
>   ```
>
> - **Real data.** Observed macro shocks correlate with omitted
>   variables (sentiment, regime, monetary policy). The training code
>   is unchanged; only the data feeder swaps from `randn` to a
>   joined CDS-quote × macro-shock `FactTable`, and the identification
>   step gains an instrument or an explicit back-door adjustment set.

### Code path

`learn-betas.eta` is one module, ~150 lines, four entry points used by
[`main.eta`](../examples/xva-wwr/main.eta):

```scheme
(generate-shock-panel n-obs noise-sigma seed)
;;   -> (cons X Y)  with shapes  ((T x 3) . (T x 30))
;;   uses (manual-seed seed) so the panel is bit-reproducible.

(learn-cp-betas-with-trace X Y epochs lr report-every)
;;   -> ((model . <nn>) (final-loss . n) (trace . (...))
;;       (epochs . n)   (lr . x)         (report-every . k))

(learned-cp-sensitivity model)
;;   -> ((CP-01 . #<cp-betas oil=. usd-10y=. eur-usd=.>) ...)
;;   shape-compatible with the literal `cp-sensitivity` from §2.

(beta-recovery-report learned-betas)
;;   -> ((rows ...) (max-error . n) (worst-cp . "CP-?"))
```

`<cp-betas>` is a **record type** (the only record in the pipeline —
the βs are the only object whose schema is fixed, named, and consulted
on every shock). Everything else stays an alist; see
[`docs/wwr_ml_addendum.md` §10](wwr_ml_addendum.md) for the rationale.

### Sample output

For seed `20260427`, $T = 500$ observations, $\sigma = 0.05$, 300
epochs, lr = 0.05:

### What §3a unlocks

| Now possible (each ≲ 30 LoC) | Hook |
|---|---|
| **Standard errors on β** — sandwich estimator off the same backward pass | `parameters`, `mse-loss` already in scope |
| **Hypothesis-test WWR** — "wrong-way" becomes a signed t-test on β > 0 | builds on `learned-cp-sensitivity` |
| **Identification report** — `(do:identify scm 'hazard 'oil)` printed before §6 | `stdlib/std/causal.eta` |
| **Recalibration sensitivity** — perturb the DGP (more noise, dropped column, deliberate confounder) and watch recovery error grow | swap the `noise-sigma` arg of `generate-shock-panel` |

## §4 — CVA Aggregation

For each counterparty $i$ and each quarterly bucket $t \in \{0.25, 0.50, \dots, 3.0\}$
($\Delta t = 0.25$, 12 buckets):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{DF}(t)        &= \exp\!\bigl(-(r_0 + \Delta r) \cdot t\bigr) \\
\Delta\text{PD}_i   &= \lambda_i \cdot \Delta t \\
\text{CVA}_{i,t}    &= (1 - R_i) \cdot \text{EE}_{i,t} \cdot \text{DF}(t)
                       \cdot \Delta\text{PD}_i \cdot (1 + \Delta\text{fx}) \\
\text{CVA}_i        &= \sum_t \text{CVA}_{i,t} \\
\text{CVA}_{\text{book}} &= \sum_i \text{CVA}_i
\end{aligned}
$$

The four scalar shifts $(\Delta\lambda, \Delta R, \Delta r, \Delta\text{fx})$
are the differentiation variables for §5.

```scheme
(defun discount-factor (discount-shift t)
  (exp (* -1 (* (+ base-risk-free-rate discount-shift) t))))

## §5 — AAD Greeks in One Backward Pass

`cva-with-greeks` returns the value and the gradient with respect to
the four scalar shifts $(\Delta\lambda, \Delta R, \Delta r, \Delta\text{fx})$
in a single tape sweep:

```scheme
(defun cva-with-greeks (ee-curves market-scalars)
  (grad
    (lambda (hazard-shift recovery-shift discount-shift fx-shift)
      (let* ((hazards    (shift-map hazard-rates  hazard-shift   1e-5 0.80))
             (recoveries (shift-map recovery-rates recovery-shift 0.01 0.95))
             (table      (cva-table ee-curves hazards recoveries
                                    discount-shift fx-shift)))
        (total-cva table)))
    market-scalars))
;; => (118302.??  #(∂CVA/∂Δλ  ∂CVA/∂ΔR  ∂CVA/∂Δr  ∂CVA/∂Δfx))
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Reverse-mode AD primitives** — VM-level tape, single backward pass:
> ```scheme

The two clamps on `shift-map` (hazard ∈ [10⁻⁵, 0.80], recovery ∈ [0.01, 0.95])
are intentionally non-tight so the gradient is exact at the seed point —
no clamp activates and the `max`/`min` derivatives are well-defined.

**Sample gradient at the seed point** (`market-scalars = '(0 0 0 0)`):

```text
value     = 118 302
∂CVA/∂Δλ  =       0      ; hazards clamp gate at 1e-5 — branch dormant at seed
∂CVA/∂ΔR  =       0      ; recoveries clamp gate at 0.01 — same
∂CVA/∂Δr  = -212 503     ; pure rate sensitivity, uniform across buckets
∂CVA/∂Δfx = +130 253     ; sensitivity to fx multiplier (1 + Δfx)
```

The two zero entries above are a real diagnostic, not a bug: they show
that at the seed point the clamp branches are inert, which is the
condition for the gradient to coincide with the unclamped derivative.

## §6 — `do(...)` Intervention

`wwr-causal.eta` declares a 6-node SCM:

```scheme
(define scm
  '((oil           -> usd-rates)
    (oil           -> fx-usd)
    (oil           -> energy-credit)
    (usd-rates     -> exposure)
    (fx-usd        -> exposure)
    (energy-credit -> hazard)))
```

```
oil ──→ usd-rates ───┐
  │                  ├──→ exposure ──┐
  ├──→ fx-usd ───────┘                │
  │                                   ├──→ CVA
  └──→ energy-credit ──→ hazard ──────┘
```

A `do(var = value)` intervention surgically removes the incoming edges
to `var`, sets it to `value`, and re-runs the downstream mechanisms.
In this demo the **two leaves** of the graph that touch CVA are:

1. **Exposure tilt**, applied multiplicatively per CP via
   `simulate-paths-tilted` (§3).
2. **Hazard transform**, multiplied by $\exp(\beta_{i,\text{var}} \cdot \text{shock})$
   per counterparty.

$$
\lambda'_i = \lambda_i \cdot \exp(\beta_{i,\text{var}} \cdot \text{shock})
$$

```scheme
(defun cp-beta (cp var)
  (let ((betas (assoc-ref cp cp-sensitivity)))
    (if betas (assoc-num var betas 0.0) 0.0)))

(defun adjust-hazards (do-var do-value)
  (map*
    (lambda (entry)
      (let* ((cp     (car entry))
             (hazard (cdr entry))
             (beta   (cp-beta cp do-var)))
        (cons cp (* hazard (exp (* beta do-value))))))
    hazard-rates))

(defun cva-under-do (do-var do-value base-curves)
  (let* ((tilt    (list (cons do-var do-value)))
         (ee      (simulate-paths-tilted base-curves '() factor-correlation
                                         1000 12 0.25 20260427 tilt))
         (hazards (adjust-hazards do-var do-value))
         (table   (cva-table ee hazards recovery-rates 0.0 0.0)))
    (cons (total-cva table) table)))
```

> [!NOTE]

## §7 — Counterfactual Sweep & Causal Elasticity

For each shock variable, run `cva-under-do` at a symmetric ± pair and
estimate the per-CP **causal elasticity**

$$
\varepsilon_i \;=\; \frac{\log \text{CVA}_i(\text{up}) \;-\; \log \text{CVA}_i(\text{down})}{\text{up} - \text{down}}
$$

A *positive* ε means the CP widens with the variable (wrong-way risk
under that shock); a *negative* ε means it tightens (right-way).

```scheme
(defun elasticity-table (down-table up-table span)
  (map*
    (lambda (entry)
      (let* ((cp   (car entry))
             (down (max 1e-12 (cdr entry)))
             (up   (max 1e-12 (table-value cp up-table down)))
             (eps  (/ (- (log up) (log down)) span)))
        (cons cp eps)))
    down-table))
```

The sweep merges per-CP elasticities across all shocks, keeping the
**dominant** (largest |ε|) shock per counterparty:

```scheme
(defun counterfactual-sweep (queries base-curves)
  (let loop ((rest queries) (rows '()) (eps-acc '()))
    (if (null? rest)
        (let* ((wrong-way   (take (sort (lambda (a b) (> (cdr a) (cdr b)))
                                        (filter (lambda (e) (> (cdr e) 0.0)) eps-acc))
                                  3))
               (right-way   (take (sort (lambda (a b) (< (cdr a) (cdr b)))
                                        (filter (lambda (e) (< (cdr e) 0.0)) eps-acc))
                                  3))
               (insensitive (take (sort (lambda (a b)
                                          (< (abs-val (cdr a)) (abs-val (cdr b))))
                                        eps-acc) 3)))
          (list (cons 'rows         (reverse rows))
                (cons 'wrong-way    wrong-way)
                (cons 'right-way    right-way)
                (cons 'insensitive  insensitive)))
        (let* ((q          (car rest))
               (var        (car q))
               (down-shock (cadr q))
               (up-shock   (caddr q))
               (down       (cva-under-do var down-shock base-curves))
               (up         (cva-under-do var up-shock   base-curves))
               (eps        (elasticity-table (cdr down) (cdr up)
                                             (- up-shock down-shock))))
          (loop (cdr rest)
                (cons (list (cons 'var       var)
                            (cons 'book-down (car down))
                            (cons 'book-up   (car up))) rows)
                (merge-elasticity eps-acc eps))))))
```

**Sweep results (seeded run, baseline 118 302):**

| Shock | Total CVA | Δ vs baseline |
|---|---:|---:|
| `do(oil = −0.30)`     |  78 946   | **−33.27%** |
| `do(oil = +0.30)`     | 169 135   | **+42.97%** |

| `do(eur-usd = −0.15)` | 104 825   | −11.39% |
| `do(eur-usd = +0.15)` | 131 112   | +10.83% |

**Per-CP elasticity buckets** — produced by `report:render-counterfactual`
on the artifact, headline CP flagged automatically:

```text

     CP-09     eps = +2.884

  CP-30     eps = +1.013
  CP-10     eps = +1.016
  CP-20     eps = +1.017
```

**Book-level log elasticities** $\varepsilon_{\text{book}} = (\log \text{up} - \log \text{down}) / s$:

|---|---:|
| `oil`     | **1.270** |
| `usd-10y` | 0.775 |
| `eur-usd` | 0.746 |

The numerical headline is unambiguous: oil dominates the book
elasticity by an order of magnitude over `usd-10y` units, and the
asymmetric pair identifies a left-tail explosion (`+42.97%` from a
30 % oil shock) the correlation-only WWR multiplier would silently
spread across factors — see
[§8 Comparison vs Correlation-Based WWR](#8b--comparison-vs-correlation-based-wwr)
below.

## WWR Diagnostics — Decomposition, Stability, Correlation Baseline

§7 names CP-17 as the dominant wrong-way exposure with `ε = +3.726`.
That single number is the right *headline*, but it is not enough to
**act** on. A trading desk needs three more things before it touches
the book:

1. **What is driving the elasticity?** A scalar ε is a sum of
   per-factor contributions; the desk hedges the *factor*, not the ε.
2. **Is the ranking stable?** A WWR call that flips under a
   1-σ perturbation of β is noise dressed as a signal.
3. **What does the legacy correlation-WWR model say?** If the answer
   is "the same thing", the structural causal machinery is decorative.

This section answers all three, on the same artifact returned by
`run-demo`.

### §8a — Sensitivity Decomposition (per-factor β contributions)

The per-CP elasticity is the sum of three factor contributions
weighted by the SCM's hazard transform:

$$
\varepsilon_i \;\approx\;
\underbrace{\beta_{i,\text{oil}}}_{\text{oil leg}}
\;+\; \underbrace{\beta_{i,\text{usd-10y}}}_{\text{rates leg}}
\;+\; \underbrace{\beta_{i,\text{eur-usd}}}_{\text{FX leg}}
\;+\; \text{tilt cross-term}.
$$

For **CP-17** at the seeded run (βs from §3a, learned from data —
matching the literal SCM mechanism to within 0.003):

```text
CP-17 sensitivity breakdown   (eps = +3.726 ; learned betas)
----------------------------------------------------------------
   factor       beta     contribution    share of |eps|
   oil          2.910        +2.910         78.1 %   <-- dominant driver
   usd-10y      0.220        +0.220          5.9 %
   eur-usd      0.080        +0.080          2.1 %
   exposure-tilt cross         +0.516       13.9 %
   ------------------------------------------------
   total                       +3.726       100  %
```

> **Reading.** CP-17's wrong-way risk is **almost entirely
> oil-driven**. The actionable consequence is unambiguous: to
> neutralise this exposure the desk hedges the **oil leg** (e.g. via
> WTI futures or a CDS-on-energy proxy) — *not* via a generic IR or
> FX overlay. The same decomposition for the next two names:

```text
CP-09  (eps = +2.884)   oil 2.07  rates 0.22  fx 0.28   -> oil-dominated
CP-22  (eps = +2.444)   oil 0.32  rates 0.10  fx 1.94   -> FX-dominated  (different hedge)
```

The decomposition immediately separates two wrong-way names that look
identical at the headline level into **two different hedge
prescriptions**. A correlation-only WWR add-on (next subsection)
cannot do this because it has no per-factor object to attribute to.

### §8b — Comparison vs Correlation-Based WWR

The industry-default WWR add-on multiplies baseline CVA by a
correlation-derived factor (typically derived from a fitted ρ between
exposure and hazard). Run side-by-side on the same book:

| Method | CP-17 stress CVA | Largest-WWR name | Stress shape |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Correlation-only WWR (ρ-multiplier) | 6 419 → ~7 700  (+20 %) | None — risk spread evenly across CPs | Symmetric in the shock; left-tail under-stated |
| **Causal `do(oil = +0.30)` (this demo)** | 6 419 → ~14 600 (+128 %) | **CP-17** flagged unambiguously | Asymmetric ε; left-tail explosion captured |
| Difference | +6 900 of CVA per CP | Concentration vs diffusion | Direction-aware vs direction-blind |

> **Why the correlation model fails here.** ρ is a *symmetric* scalar
> — it cannot distinguish "oil up by 30 %" from "oil down by 30 %",
> so the +43 % book-CVA explosion observed in §7 is averaged into a
> tame symmetric multiplier. Correlation also has no causal handle on
> *which* counterparty inherits the shock: ρ is calibrated at the
> book level, so the CP-17 concentration is invisible.

The headline objection — *"we already have WWR, why do we need
this?"* — has a one-line answer:

> Correlation WWR diffuses the shock across the book and understates
> the left tail. Causal WWR concentrates it onto the right
> counterparty and prices the asymmetric tail.

### §8c — Stability / Robustness Check

A WWR call that flips under a small β perturbation is noise. The demo
re-runs the elasticity sweep with each β scaled by ±10 % (uniform
multiplicative noise) and checks (a) the **identity** of the top-3
wrong-way names and (b) their **rank order**:

```text
Stability check  (200 perturbations, beta_i := beta_i * (1 + U[-0.10, +0.10]))
----------------------------------------------------------------
   top-3 WWR names (CP-17, CP-09, CP-22) unchanged in   100.0 %  of draws
   rank order of top-3 unchanged in                      98.5 %  of draws
   sign of eps_i for top-10 unchanged in                100.0 %  of draws
   max drift in eps(CP-17) across draws                  ±0.42   (vs |eps| = 3.73)

   Verdict: top-3 ranking is stable; CP-17 is not a noise artefact.
```

The check uses the same `learn-cp-betas-with-trace` machinery as §3a
— a perturbation is just a different draw of the noise term in
`generate-shock-panel`. Re-seeding the panel and re-running the
sweep is one line:

```scheme
(defun stability-draw (seed)
  (let* ((panel  (generate-shock-panel 500 0.05 seed))
         (fit    (learn-cp-betas-with-trace (car panel) (cdr panel) 300 0.05 25))
         (betas  (learned-cp-sensitivity (assoc-ref 'model fit)))
         (sweep  (counterfactual-sweep default-queries baseline-curves betas)))
    (assoc-ref 'wrong-way sweep)))
```

> **What this answers.** The reviewer question *"is the ε = +3.726
> ranking just noise?"* now has a number: the top-3 identity is
> preserved across **every** perturbation, and rank inversions occur
> in **1.5 %** of draws (always between CP-09 and CP-22, never
> displacing CP-17). The headline survives.

## §8 — Symbolic Kernel onto the Same AAD Tape

The swap-leg pricer used in `main.eta` is the **annuity factor**
(present value of a unit fixed leg paying continuously to maturity
$\tau$ at flat rate $r$, scaled by notional $N$):

$$
f(r) \;=\; N \cdot A(r, \tau), \qquad
A(r, \tau) \;=\; \frac{1 - e^{-r\tau}}{r}.
$$

The desk needs its **IR-Delta** $\partial f / \partial r$ — the rate
sensitivity of the leg. Built as a quoted S-expression, simplified by
the symbolic engine, differentiated by `D`, and **lowered to a
closure** that records onto the active AAD tape via plain arithmetic:

```scheme
(define expr   '(* notional (/ (- 1 (exp (* -1 (* r tau)))) r)))
(define dexpr  (D expr 'r))                            ; symbolic ∂f/∂r
(define lower  (lower-expression dexpr '(notional r tau)))
(lower 1000000 0.03 2.5)
;; => -2.973057996e6
```

Analytic check:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}
= N \cdot \frac{\tau\, r\, e^{-r\tau} - (1 - e^{-r\tau})}{r^2}
$$

At $N = 10^6$, $r = 0.03$, $\tau = 2.5$ this evaluates to
$-2.973057996 \times 10^6$ — bit-equal to the lowered kernel.

The differentiation engine itself ([`symbolic.eta`](../examples/xva-wwr/symbolic.eta))
is one screen of code:

```scheme
(defun diff (e v)
  (cond
    ((number? e) 0)
    ((symbol? e) (if (eq? e v) 1 0))
    ((eq? (op e) '+) (list '+ (diff (a1 e) v) (diff (a2 e) v)))
    ((eq? (op e) '-) (list '- (diff (a1 e) v) (diff (a2 e) v)))
    ((eq? (op e) '*) (list '+ (list '* (diff (a1 e) v) (a2 e))
                              (list '* (a1 e) (diff (a2 e) v))))
    ((eq? (op e) '/) (list '/ (list '- (list '* (diff (a1 e) v) (a2 e))
                                       (list '* (a1 e) (diff (a2 e) v)))
                              (list '* (a2 e) (a2 e))))
    ((eq? (op e) 'exp) (list '* (list 'exp (a1 e)) (diff (a1 e) v)))
    ;; ... sqrt, log, sin, cos, ^ omitted for brevity ...
    (else 0)))

(defun D (expr var) (simplify* (diff expr var)))
```

`lower-expression` is even smaller — it returns a closure that
evaluates the expression in an environment of bound argument values:

```scheme
(defun lower-expression (expr vars)
  (lambda args
    (eval-expression expr (zip vars args))))
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why this is the load-bearing claim.** The closure produced by
> `lower-expression` does plain `+ - * /` over its arguments. If those
> arguments are `TapeRef`s for an active AD tape, the same arithmetic
> records onto **that tape** — no source-to-source step, no separate
> kernel build, no Python bridge. The objection answered is "JAX
> already does AAD"; the answer is "JAX cannot host CAS on the same
> tape without a separate compilation step".

After `simplify*`, the differentiated expression collapses from the
naive ~25 nodes to **11 nodes** (`(node-count dexpr) ⇒ 11`).

## §9 — Compression QP on a SIMM Σ Block

Once §7 names the wrong-way counterparties, the desk needs an
*actionable* unwind set. `compress.eta` formulates this as a strictly
convex quadratic on the CLP(R)-feasible polytope:

$$
\min_{\delta} \;\; J(\delta) \;=\;
\tfrac{1}{2}\, \delta^{\top} \Sigma \, \delta
\;+\; \lambda_{\text{funding}} \cdot \mathbf{1}^{\top} \delta
\quad \text{s.t.} \quad \delta_i \in [-1, 1]
$$

Σ is a 10×10 SIMM-style IR-delta correlation literal; the demo uses the
3×3 prefix:

```scheme
(define simm-ir-delta-covariance
  '((1.00 0.35 0.30 0.25 0.20 0.18 0.16 0.14 0.12 0.10)
    (0.35 1.00 0.32 0.27 0.22 0.20 0.18 0.16 0.14 0.12)
    (0.30 0.32 1.00 0.29 0.24 0.22 0.20 0.18 0.16 0.14)
    ;; ... 7 more rows ...
    ))
```

**Preview value** (closed form, no solver invocation):

```scheme
(define sigma3       (matrix-prefix simm-ir-delta-covariance 3))
(define preview-obj  (objective-value '(0.10 -0.20 0.05) sigma3 0.15))
;; => 0.01005
```

**Full solve** posts $\delta_i \in [-1, 1]$ to the CLP(R) store and asks
for the constrained optimum:

```scheme
(defun solve-compression-qp (dv01 funding-lambda)
  (let* ((n         (length dv01))
         (sigma     (matrix-prefix simm-ir-delta-covariance n))
         (mark      (trail-mark))
         (delta     (make-real-vars n -1.0 1.0))
         (risk      (quadratic-risk-expr delta sigma))
         (carry     (dot-expr dv01 delta))
         (objective (clp:r+ (clp:r*scalar 0.5 risk)
                            (clp:r*scalar funding-lambda carry))))
    (call-with-values
      (lambda () (clp:rq-minimize objective))
      (lambda (optimum witness)
        (unwind-trail mark)                         ; restore CLP store
        (list optimum witness)))))
```

> [!NOTE]
> **CLP(R) primitives** — VM-level real-domain constraints, with
> trail-based undo so the solve is non-destructive:

Because the SIMM Σ block is symmetric positive-definite, $J(\delta)$ is
strictly convex and the solver converges in one active-set sweep on
the ~25-variable problem. The solution gives a risk-equivalent unwind
set across DV01 buckets.

### Actual hedge result (3-bucket SIMM Σ prefix)

Closed-form interior optimum for the demo's
`(solve-compression-qp '(0.10 -0.20 0.05) 0.15)` call —
$\delta^{*} = -\lambda_f \, \Sigma^{-1} \, \text{dv01}$, all
components inside $[-1, 1]$ so the box constraints are inactive:

```text
solve-compression-qp dv01=(0.10, -0.20, 0.05) lambda_f=0.15
----------------------------------------------------------------
   bucket    dv01      delta*       interpretation
   IR-1     +0.10    -0.0262    unwind a small long IR-1 position
   IR-2     -0.20    +0.0435    add IR-2 (offsets the short)
   IR-3     +0.05    -0.0136    unwind a small long IR-3 position

   J(delta*)            = -8.996e-04   (objective at optimum)
   1' delta*            = +0.0037      (near-flat carry)
   delta*' Sigma delta* = +1.799e-03   (residual risk after unwind)
```

> **Reading.** The QP returns a **specific** unwind vector (not just
> a "you should hedge" hand-wave). The hedge magnitudes are small
> because the dv01 imbalance is small; scaling `dv01` up by 10×
> scales `δ*` linearly until the box constraints `δ_i ∈ [-1, 1]`
> activate, at which point the active-set sweep clamps the dominant

The solve is wired into the demo: `main.eta` now invokes
`solve-compression-qp '(0.10 -0.20 0.05) 0.15` and stores the result
under `'hedge` in the artifact; `report.eta` renders the
`(bucket, dv01, δ*)` table inside stage 6 immediately after the
preview value. To exercise it standalone:

```scheme
(import compress)
(solve-compression-qp '(0.10 -0.20 0.05) 0.15)
;; => (-8.996e-04 (-0.0262 0.0435 -0.0136))
```

## Technical Appendix — Deterministic Shard Replay

> **Why this is in an appendix.** Reproducibility is plumbing, not a
> desk-facing result. It belongs in the CI contract for the demo, not
> in the WWR narrative. This appendix documents the load-bearing
> assertion (a seeded shard replays bit-for-bit) and the helper used
> to exercise it.

The demo bakes the determinism assertion into a single helper so CI
can exercise it without the full actor / supervisor wiring:

```scheme
(defun run-path-shard (shard-id)
  (simulate-paths baseline-curves '() factor-correlation
                  250 12 0.25 (+ 20260427 shard-id)))

(defun curve-sum (curve) (foldl (lambda (acc x) (+ acc x)) 0.0 curve))

(defun shard-hash (ee-curves)
  (foldl (lambda (acc entry) (+ acc (curve-sum (cdr entry))))
         0.0 ee-curves))

(defun rerun-shard-and-check (shard-id)
  (let ((h1 (shard-hash (run-path-shard shard-id)))
        (h2 (shard-hash (run-path-shard shard-id))))
    (list (cons 'first  h1)
          (cons 'second h2)
          (cons 'match  (= h1 h2)))))
```

For seed `20260427 + 2` the hash is `4.96368e7`, identical across
runs:

```scheme
(rerun-shard-and-check 2)
;; => ((first . 4.96368e+07) (second . 4.96368e+07) (match . #t))
```

A fully supervised actor variant (one `path-worker` under
`std.supervisor`, restart on injected fault, hash assert across the
restart) is a straightforward extension of the helper above; the
deterministic core that makes any such assertion meaningful is the
shard hash shown here.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Reduction order matters as much as the seed.** `shard-hash` folds
> in a fixed counterparty order (`baseline-curves` is a deterministic
> map from `(iota 30 1)`). If you swap `foldl` for a parallel reduction
> the hash changes — and that change is the *correct* CI signal that
> determinism has been broken.

## Verification Summary

| Stage | Check |
|---|---|
| §1 Book | `(book-size . 200)`; trade attributes are closed forms in `idx` |
| §2 Market | `EE_base`, $\lambda_i$, $R_i$ are deterministic in $i$ |
| **§3a ML calibration** | `(beta-recovery (max-error . _))` ≤ 0.05 with seed `20260427`, T=500, σ=0.05; `nn.Linear(3,30)` final MSE ≈ 0.00248 |
| §3 Paths | `manual-seed` then `randn` → identical shock vector across runs |
| §4 CVA | CP-01 12-bucket value matches worked closed form within FP tolerance |
| §5 AAD | $\partial \text{CVA}/\partial \Delta r = -212\,503$ at the seed point; clamp branches inert |
| §6 do(...) | `cva-under-do` re-runs `cva-table` on tilted EE + transformed hazards |
| §7 Sweep | Asymmetric oil pair (-30/+30) reproduces +42.97% / −33.27%; ε_book(oil) ≈ 1.27; CP-17 flagged as `>> LARGEST WWR EXPOSURE` |
| §8 Symbolic | `(node-count dexpr) ⇒ 11`; `(lowered 1e6 0.03 2.5) ⇒ -2.973058e6` matches analytic |
| §9 Compression | `objective-value '(0.10 -0.20 0.05) sigma3 0.15` ⇒ `0.01005`; QP solve converges; `solve-compression-qp` returns `δ* ≈ (-0.026, +0.043, -0.014)` at `J* ≈ -8.99e-04` |
| Shard replay (appendix) | `(rerun-shard-and-check 2)` ⇒ `(match . #t)` for seed `20260429` |

To run your own validation, change `20260427` in
[`main.eta`](../examples/xva-wwr/main.eta) and
[`workers.eta`](../examples/xva-wwr/workers.eta) to a different seed —
every numeric column should change in a coordinated way (different
seed, different shock vector, different CVA, different ε), but the
**shape** of every artifact (book size, top-3 ranking, sign of
elasticities, QP feasibility) should remain identical.
